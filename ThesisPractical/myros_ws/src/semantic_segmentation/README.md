Original semantic-segmentation package for ros1 can be found here: https://github.com/dheera/ros-semantic-segmentation/tree/master/semantic_segmentation/nodes

If you want to use your own model, just add it to the models folder and pass the name of your model folder into the
'segmentation_model' parameter when launching the node.

Don't forget to install the dependencies of your own models as well.
